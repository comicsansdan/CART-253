# Project 2: Melody Tower

Melody Tower is a platforming videogame that experiments with the p5.sound library (mainly the p5.PolySynth function). It utilizes other things such as images, loops, arrays, conditionals, object-orientated-programming and practically everything I've learned this semester. The game is experienced best with SOUND ON, so ENJOY! The link to the project is here: [Project 2: Melody Tower](https://danielcacatian.github.io/CART-253/projects/project2/)

## Artist's statement

This project has given me a fun opportunity to experiment with the wonders of programming. I figured, why not utilize everything I learned throughout this semester and create a fun interactive videogame. Not just your average game, however, or a copy of another game coded in P5.js. There are plenty of things you can do with P5.js, so why not just mess around with it all and apply it to a game concept. For this project, I mainly experimented with sound to create this neat project. It may not be perfect, but you usually never get it perfect on the first try. However, knowing that it is possible opens to more fun music-related ideas in the future. I can always come back to this idea and expand upon it, perhaps making a huge game. Either way, I canâ€™t wait to learn more about programming and, in turn, create more games in weird, fun and creative ways with it.
